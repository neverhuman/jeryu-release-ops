# jeryu-release-ops

[![Jankurai score: 93/100](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jankurai-93%2F100-brightgreen)](ops/ci/score.sh)

Release, signing, governance, observability, and compliance tooling.

This repository is also the single authority for the independently released
Jeryu family. [`repos.manifest.toml`](repos.manifest.toml) binds the exact
`/home/ubuntu/jain-split/jeryu-split` root, `jeryu/*` forge identities, v5 tag
lineage, and the canonical sibling `jain-redline` dependency. Container and
portal manifests are projections of this authority, not competing sources.

Live read-only forge verification on 2026-07-27 resolved protected `main` and
the immutable `jeryu-release-ops-v5.0.0-split.3` tag to the same commit,
`1064853e9c182df83d0ce45e1a1dfd496664794c`. A control-plane source successor
binds that exact released base as `predecessor_tag`; after protected merge it
receives the next immutable tag. Product rows instead bind their current
released identities with `current_tag`.

The authority is currently in compliance inventory. Its non-waivable contract
requires Jankurai score 85 or higher; zero caps, hard findings, soft findings,
disabled rules, or allowed score drop; hand-authored files no longer than 500
lines with 300 as the refactoring target; and ordinary Git blobs no larger than
1,048,576 bytes. Every repository explicitly declares whether authenticated
local Jeryu LFS is required. Inventory records migration debt but never exempts
it; the state may advance to `enforced` and may not roll back.

This repository was seeded from Jeryu source commit `cbecf7caa0e932c76a341b2521e66e911233860d` by
`ops/split/materialize.py`. It is part of the 11-repository Jeryu split family and keeps source
paths stable where practical so ownership remains auditable.

Repository-specific agent instructions and ownership boundaries start in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Getting Started

Install the Rust toolchain declared by `rust-toolchain.toml` and
[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), then run the deterministic local gate:

```bash
just fast
```

Before proposing release evidence, run the complete source-readiness lane:

```bash
just release-readiness
```

That lane is non-promoting: deployment and production mutation remain owned by
`jeryu-deploy`.

`ops/ci/redline-consumer.sh` emits checksummed Redline compatibility evidence
only from clean, forge-equal `main`, a passing family receipt, and the exact
immutable engine tag resolved by `Cargo.lock`. The operator must also pass the
canonical Jeryu split manifest with `--consumer-manifest`; the script hashes it
alongside this repository's `agent/audit-policy.toml` instead of inferring a
manifest from the consumer checkout. The current reviewed dependency is
`redline-core-v4.1.0-jain.6` at
`d0de59930141baffcfa2b514480e75b14627f24d`.
