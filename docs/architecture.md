# Architecture

`jeryu-release-ops` is part of the Jeryu split family.

The public portal is `neverhuman/jeryu`. Release authority remains
`neverhuman/jeryu-deploy`; split member repositories own bounded product
surfaces and consume sibling crates from pinned public Git tags.

## Boundaries

- Profile: `rust-workspace`
- Required check: `jeryu-release-ops/required`
- Local release source of truth: `agent/boundaries.toml`
- Redline runtime: immutable `redline-core-v4.1.0-jain.4` at protected commit
  `3567bdced0ca1fe3671c9ebda876c914e2fc2c9e`; the locked Rust dependency and
  consumer producer must resolve that same identity.
